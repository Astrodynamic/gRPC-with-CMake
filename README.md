# Project README

## Overview

This project aims to provide a hands-on experience with gRPC and Protocol Buffers (protobuf) while using C++. It serves as a practical guide for setting up and configuring a gRPC server and client in C++, alongside exploring the intricacies of protobuf.

## Objectives

- **Learn gRPC and Protocol Buffers**: Understand the fundamentals of gRPC and protobuf, their uses, and benefits.
- **Develop in C++**: Gain practical experience in C++ by implementing a gRPC server and client.
- **Server and Client Configuration**: Learn to set up and configure a gRPC server and client in C++.
- **Protobuf Handling**: Delve into creating and using protobuf files in a C++ environment.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of C++.
- Familiarity with RPC (Remote Procedure Call) concepts.
- Development environment set up for C++ (e.g., g++, CMake).
- gRPC and protobuf installed on your machine.

## Conclusion

This project provides a foundational understanding of gRPC and Protocol Buffers in a C++ environment. By following this guide, you will learn to create and use protobuf files, implement a gRPC server and client, and configure the necessary build environment.
